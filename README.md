====================

 J.A.R.V.I.S. like program for windows.
A very basic GUI wrapper for Windows Speech Recognition in C#.

Drawback with this build-WSR(Windows Speech Recognition)the WSR SDK with 
speech macros is easier to implement changes to.

A better approach is to build your own wrapper and GUI for WSR.

Things I will implement in my wrapper-
WSRMacro support
VBscript support
A Form to edit the WSRMacros and VBscripts.

 I plan to build an actual A.I. and incorporate WSR or system.speech.
